> The Official ReScript Bindings for ReactJS

- [Documentation](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction)

### Transition Plan (reason-react -> rescript-react)

- Existing users want to upgrade from `reason-react@0.9` to `rescript-react@0.10` (should be a smooth transition, check out the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for minor breaking changes)
- Make sure that all community libraries that are still on `reason-react` publish a new `@rescript/react` version as well (for compatibility reasons)
- We will soon publish our `v1.0` changes, with a new `react-jsx` version and some other cool features! Check out our [RFC post](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/rfc-rescript-react/901) for more infos.

### Installation

#### React-JSX transformation V4

- [Documentation](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/blob/master/cli/JSXV4.md)

The ReScript compiler V10.1+ is required.

```
npm install @rescript/react --save
```

In your `bsconfig.json`:

```
{
  "jsx": { "version": 4, "mode": "classic" },
  "bs-dependencies": ["@rescript/react"]
}
```

If you want to try [the new jsx transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) which was introduced in React v17, set the `"mode": "automatic"`.

If you want to try build your project with JSX v3, see [the V3 compatibility mode](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/blob/master/cli/JSXV4.md)
